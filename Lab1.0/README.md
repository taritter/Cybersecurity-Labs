## Cybersecurity Lab 1

This is a simple log in program for SpyHub, a fake company that contains spys, supervisors, and the technical assistants to spys. There are six menu options when signing in:
* profile
* blueprint/maps
* police data
* weapons
* admin
* assignments

A spy has access to assignments, their profile, blueprints/maps, and weapons. The supervisor has access to everything, including admin access. The technical assistant has access to everything except admin access and assignments as they aren't allowed to see past and current assignment. The current csv file contains the users, passwords, and access level.

# Testing
